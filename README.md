# ToDoListOnline

## Overview
ToDoList Online is a dynamic web application that simplifies task management. Built with React and integrated with Firebase for authentication, this app offers a user-friendly platform to register, log in, and manage tasks efficiently. Users can add, edit, and delete tasks, making it easier to keep track of daily activities.

## Features
- **User Registration and Login**: Register and log in using email and password.
- **Task Management**: Once logged in, users can:
  - Add new tasks to their list.
  - Edit existing tasks.
  - Delete tasks they no longer need.

## Under Construction
This project is actively being developed, and several features are in the pipeline to enhance its functionality:
- **Password check**: Check for password strength, length, and input validation
- **Logout Functionality**: A logout option for users to securely exit their session is forthcoming.
- **Persistent User Tasks**: Future updates will allow tasks to be saved per user account, ensuring that each user's task list is preserved between sessions.
- **Database Integration**: Plans to integrate a database for secure storage of user credentials and tasks are underway. This will enhance the app's security and user experience.
